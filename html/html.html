	<h1>HTML History</h1>
	<p>HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.<br>
		HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.<br>
		Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.<br>
		Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.<br>
		hen comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.<br></p>

			<h1>Where HTML is used</h1>
			<p>HTML is a set of codes that a website author inserts into a plain text file to format the content. The author inserts HTML tags, or commands, before and after words or phrases to indicate their format and location on the page. HTML tags are also used to add tables, lists, images, music, and other elements to a webpage.

Web documents contain three main sections: the head, title, and body. The head includes the webpage’s identifying information, including the website’s title and important keywords. The viewer sees the site’s title, but any other information is hidden. The site’s title appears in the browser’s tab and is what appears when a user tries to bookmark a site. The body section is the main portion of the webpage visible to the viewer, including the text and graphics. HTML tags are also used in two additional ways that are not visible to the viewer: as meta tags and comments. Meta tags indicate keywords associated with the webpage to search engines. Comments are intended as explanation or additional information for other writers or readers of HTML code.

Website authors do not need to write HTML code themselves to create a webpage. Using an HTML editor, site authors design web documents while the program writes the HTML code. A WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) HTML editor is a software program with an interface similar to a word processing program that site authors use to write and format text and position graphics as they will appear on the webpage.</p>

<strong>Our HTML Learning Area features multiple modules that teach HTML from the ground up — no previous knowledge required.</strong><br>

1-Introduction to HTML
This module sets the stage, getting you used to important concepts and syntax such as looking at applying HTML to text, how to create hyperlinks, and how to use HTML to structure a web page.<br>
2-Multimedia and embedding
This module explores how to use HTML to include multimedia in your web pages, including the different ways that images can be included, and how to embed video, audio, and even entire other webpages.<br>
3-HTML tables
Representing tabular data on a webpage in an understandable, accessible way can be a challenge. This module covers basic table markup, along with more complex features such as implementing captions and summaries.<br>
4-HTML forms
Forms are a very important part of the Web — these provide much of the functionality you need for interacting with websites, e.g. registering and logging in, sending feedback, buying products, and more. This module gets you started with creating the client-side/front-end parts of forms.<br>
5-Use HTML to solve common problems
Provides links to sections of content explaining how to use HTML to solve very common problems when creating a web page: dealing with titles, adding images or videos, emphasizing content, creating a basic form, etc.<br>

	<h1>Advanced Topic</h1>
	<p>ORS enabled image
The crossorigin attribute, in combination with an appropriate CORS header, allows images defined by the <strong>img</strong> tag element to be loaded from foreign origins and used in a <strong>canvas</strong> tag element as if they were being loaded from the current origin.
CORS settings attributes
Some HTML elements that provide support for CORS, such as <strong>img</strong> or <strong>video</strong>, have a crossorigin attribute (crossOrigin property), which lets you configure the CORS requests for the element's fetched data.
Preloading content with rel="preload"
The preload value of the <strong>link</strong> element's rel attribute allows you to write declarative fetch requests in your HTML <strong> head</strong>, specifying resources that your pages will need very soon after loading, which you therefore want to start preloading early in the lifecycle of a page load, before the browser's main rendering machinery kicks in. This ensures that they are made available earlier and are less likely to block the page's first render, leading to performance improvements. This article provides a basic guide to how preload works</p>
